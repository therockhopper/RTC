My [Onyx Boox Note Air 2](https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair2) supports templates for its notes.
To take advantage of this, you just need to create a PDF template and upload it to your Boox's template directory. I use [Boox Drop](https://onyxboox.medium.com/how-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-your-boox-21a98e46ed8d) for this.

I use the following templates:
- Daily -- Personal use for TODO items.
- Weekly -- High level weekly planner.
- Project -- So I can attempt to plan yet another failed side project
- Work Week -- Scratchpad for work related notes when Jira won't load.
